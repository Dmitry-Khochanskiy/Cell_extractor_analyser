# Bio-image Analysis tools 
A flexible pipeline for biological data extraction, analysis and visualization

# Prerequisites
Anaconda
Env can be loaded from pytorchenv.yml

# Usage
Functions can be imported in a module
1st notebook - segmenation and cell images extraction into cell objects. R-CNN and UNet can be used for localization and masking
2d notebook - per cell object based analysis
3d notebook - fancy graphics and simple implimentation of ML
4d notebook - plotting labeled cell objects on the original image, creating montage  

# To do
- [ ] Add a complete scripting pipeline 
- [ ] Implement R-CNN localization and UNet segmentation
- [ ] Possible interactive mode
- [ ] Code polishing, proper docstrings
