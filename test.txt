1. A. First of all we will analyze data for its quiality and consistency, both in bio-medical and statistical sence. It should be done by the company before, but we have to check it anyway. We will check for good represantation of patients from the clinical trial group - their age, gender, comorbidities, melanoma staging. We have to know better the trial patients group and the logic before its formation. I assume in this trial patients with advanced diseas have been chosen.
The same goes with histological slides - we will check their quiality (e.g. if patients' tissues were proceeded within the same histo-pathological lab) and other feautures - source (skin, biopsy, other), the size of tumor on the slides, its feature like invasivness etc. This features can be included into the final panel.
 If the data is good we can built some simple ML models on this data alone like random forest, which allow us to see feature importance. On this stage we can also use clastering algorythms like Density-Based Clustering to check if our patients form diffrenet and Discernible clusters. Sometimes diseases heterogenity can lead to a fealure of a trial, especially with target treatment.
B. Melanomas are know to have higly polymorphic tumor cells. in case of a given diagnosis the features of tumor cells thenmselves - their shape, nuclear morphology, signs of apoptosis/necrosis won't give us any additional information - we already have diagnosis. Thus we'd better look at the tumor as a whole. I'd select the size of tumor, its invasivness, presense necrosis and angiogenesis, probably features of parenchime. Another very important aspect is the infiltration of the tumor with immune cells. For example the grade of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes being an independent predictor of survival irrespective of the treatment type[1]. Thus the nu,ber of infiltrating immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, should be measured and included as a feature.
C. Though overall survival is better end point measurment than progression-free survival from a practical clinician and patient point of view,progression free survival is more preferable for clinical trials which are limited with time. It is alos more robust, for example it doesn't take into account affecet of subsequent treatments. In case of a good match for target therapy OP and PFS will come closer.


2. I assume these are multichannel images, taken from a fluorescent or confocal microscope. Given the list of antibodies we expect to see labeled T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and PD-L1-positive cells, which are probably tumor cells. It is porbably trial for a new PD-L1 inhibitor alone or with a combination.
A. 
We start with the standart assesment of images data - its quality, quantity, is it representativness. I'll take a look at general moprhology of "tumor" cells both on - their shape,their size, the shape of their nuclei, their heterogenity, other particular qualitive features. Also I'll look into account parenchima and blood vessels nearby- the number and morphology of blood vessess (do they have defecets in its endothelium linings), presense of hemmoragues, the number and morphology of parenchine tuissues. I have no information the organ of origin of the species, but with this information I can deduce other features to select. Immune cells themsleves are more interesting by their types, not morphology.  
Lets' say we seleceted few features - the number, area, PD-L1 intesnity and morphology of PD-L1 postivie cells, their spatial relationships towards each other and immune cells. After that we use a image analysis to extract this features from an image in an automatic way. Extractig of cells and their thresholding can be acomplished with r-CNN and UNet if we have a trained model. We may devise few new metrics for each image, like immune cell infiltration score, which can be considered as feature engeneering.
When we have all features as numbers for each patient we perfom a descriptive statistical analysis and make a model, linking these features with the outcome. For this we'd better use classical ML approaches like logistic regression, random forest or SVM - anything which can assign a feature importance and is easelly interpretable ( so no deep learning yet). If we see the features we selected or created or selected are important we may go with them for model refining. 
B. 
Cells are usually typed (or labeled) manually by a trained histologist/pathologist/cytologist which is considered as a gold standart. Drawback of this - it's expensive, time consuming, depends heavally on the qualification of the specialist and it's not easy to compare labeling, made by several specialist. It is especally problematic for a "hard" data like segmentation of tumor cells.  
Second way - automatic labeling, given algorythms. It may use quite simple teqnicques lie Otsy thesholding, or require deep learning - like an already mentioned r-CNN and UNet. In case of simple algyrthm is is usually fats, but require an extensive image preparation and feature selection. using deep learning is effectiv and precise, but needs a well-trained model, which may be limiting for rare or unusual data. 
The third way semi-supervised labeling - a combination of automatic and manual labiling, which combines machine and human labing. It's faster than human only, more precise than machine only and can be used to create a precise and efficient ML model on a new data.
C.
I've mentioned some features before - cell morphology, spatial relationship between cells, details of parenchime. We must decide right features emperically with feature selection and literare information of a given tumor type. H&E can be used for creating additional features, which will be included in the final 'feature list' for each patient for model traiming.

3.
It can be used, but I couldn't answer for sure for representative of a company before getting more information. What kind of cancer? What kind of treatment? Of what subset of population? 
For example an immune cell infiltration of tumors is a predictive feature for some types of cancer, like melanoma. It is especially important for some kind of immune therapies like CAR-T therapy. If we study the CAR-T therapy from infiltrating T-lymphocyes in melanoma we really do bennefit from labeling immune cells and cancer cells. Another option - CAR-T with double targeting. In this case we need to be sure about colocolization of the target antigens in the tumor cells. Third option - a cancer tharapy agains cancer stemm cells - we need to label not just cancer cells, but stemm cells among them.  Multiplex imaging can be usefull and even crucail in a lot of cases, but for each case its use shoudl be adjusted.

4. 
A. Forming the goal - we need to think througly about our end point goal as an imaghing branch of a trial. What metrics we will use? What's a desired results for these mectrics from the custumore? We'll devise the list of model to use at this stage. For example if we need a classification we need to select good machine vision models, better already trained of a similar data.
Exploratory data analsysis and forming a traning dataset- we'll take a look at avalaible data, check it for integrity, perform cleaning, feature engeneering and preparatuions for ML learning (like standartisation). The programming rule of garbage in- garbage out apllyes here, even the best ML model can't produce satisfyng results with a bad dataset.
Our first model, which can be simple and shallow, will be used as a baseline model. If we see that it's has high bias low variance it means we're underfitting and have a degree of freedom to increase the complexity of a model. Then we'll search for more complex models and try different hyperparameters, aiming for increasing of metrics without overfitting. 
Once we have a working, optimally fit model, we need to test it on a separate test dataset. The last step - comparing the perfomance of a model agains a human - a golden standart.
B. Potential roadblocks - data quality and quantity. If the quality is bad (bad slices because of a sloppy histological work) we need to invest a great time and effor in cleaning and even than it may bot be enough.  The quantity matters too - deep learning generally requires a lot of data to provenet overfitting;
Models underfitting and overfitting. The last one is more troublesome to troubleshout and my be connected to both the model and the traning dataset.
Bad generalization of data. Even if our model doesn't overfit on a traning set we received it may work worse in the real world. In this case we need to return back to the training data set and try to include more variable data points. Vigeruous testing is required on all steps.

C.Which features will you add to the analysis and how will you combine them with the H&E data?
It depends on the tumor type and the type of treatment. Patient's general features (age, gender, weight)  are obligatory, other things may be of great importance too - e.g. blood work for patients with lymphomas, neurological status for patients with neuro tumors. Another case - the use of RNA-seq or other sequencing data in combination with our machine vision model[2]. the use of liquid biopsy[3]. In any case we're interested in creating a mdeol, which predict the response to the treatment based on features. Our ML model on a H&E produces such a feature, which can be 'fed' among other features to a higher order model - be it an ensamble model like random forest or xgboost or another artificial network.
